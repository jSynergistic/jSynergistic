# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @jSynergistic !

I've been working in web development for about 17 years, at first in a small web agency as a web developer, mainly using [PHP](https://www.php.net/) ; then I quickly became technical director of the agency, which gave me a real opportunity to learn fullstack web development, using [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML), and a bit of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/Javascript) (essentially using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) at this time where Internet Explorer 6 was condemning us to so many sacrifices üòÜ).

I worked for years mainly using PHP for the backend side, and I took advantage of this period creating an [MVC](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod%C3%A8le-vue-contr%C3%B4leur) framework, including an automatic [CRUD](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD), and using JavaScript (ES4), HTML v4, and CSS v2.1 for the frontend (in a way, the prehistory of the internet).

It makes me remember Internet Explorer in its v5.5 and v6, which didn't support the [PNG](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) images' alpha channels üòÖ, which had for consequences **lots of difficulties** for integrating complex designs. 

Also, when the designer was delivering me Dreamweaver's generated static pages, based on deeply nested HTML tables layouts, on which I had to replace the static parts by dynamic ones (i.e. data from a database), it was sometimes a real nightmare, believe me ; the slightest mistake on a level directly made the entire layout break down ü§Ø).

Concerning the designs at that time, there was no consideration about the emerging market of smartphones and tablets (what we call today responsive or adaptative designs), and layouts were so condensed ! With sometimes font sizes of 10px (or less !), making the whole completely unreadable

CSS was hardly beginning to be used, and on top of that, accessibility seemed to be considered as important by no one.

JavaScript was mostly used for useless blinking animations, useless effects mostly just harmul for the eyes. Useless and boring are the two notions that comes to me when I think about them at that time. 

Many developers also thought they could replace server-side data validation by client-side ones (which can be user-friendly because they offer immediate feedback about client input in forms) ; but they forgot too often that this could at moqt represent a bonus enhancing user experience, but in no case could constitute a replacement to server-side user inputs validations. 

There were also these so ridiculous "Best viewed on `Best viewed on X browser version Y`" badges because each browser vendor had their own implementations of CSS and JavaScript ; this was completely counter intuitive for lambda users who didn't have to worry about these details.

On the development side... 

- No "hot reload", 
- No pre/post processors neither

We were forced too refresh manually the browser on each code modification, which was tedious, annoying.

When I manage interns today, I can't tell them how lucky they are to have such powerful tools available:

- VS Code and its extensions, for linting and code formatting among many other features
- Webpack / Rollup to build optimized bundles (increasing load speed)
- NPM / Yarn / PNPM, aloowing access to millions of packages (following the DRTW principle) 
- Important progress made with ES5, and ES6 and laters. 
- Also, to note, the recent adoption of Microsoft's browser rendering engine to the Chromium's one, and the notable acceleration of updates on theses browsers, allowing us to use the most recent features of EcmaScript, and CSS without waiting for years.

Clearly, I really think Web Development is most enjoyable today than ever considering the number of orientations available :

- Frameworks & libraries such as Angular, React, Vue.js concerning the frontend

- Cloud architectures (Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Azure allowing easily scalable web apps)

- Headless CMS

- [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) : g√©n√©ration de sites statiques  offrant g√©n√©ralement d'excellentes performances (le serveur se contentant d'envoyer en tant que "r√©ponse" un fichier statique ne n√©cessitant aucun traitement)

- Collaborative sandbox platforms such as [Codepen](https://codepen.io/), [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), and many others.

More rencently, [VSCode released an offile version of the editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev).

## üëÄ What am I interested in ?

I enjoy always watching innovations concerning the evolution of Internet, whether from a technological point of view, but also from the sociological impact of its usages.

I'm also very interested in general culture, reading books (whether novels, science fiction, classics, but also philosophy).

## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning...

Mostly advanced uses of Javascript and CSS ; I decided a while ago to specialize on the "front" aspect, because the best application ever would be just useless with an awful user experience, as well as the biggest encyclopedia could as well be empty if the information it contains isn't accessible to everyone.

I mainly use React with Typescript in order to build more robust web applications. I also enjoy using CSS (but also CSS-in-JS, Styled Components as well as UI libraries such as MaterialUI, TailwindCSS, ChakraUI, etc.) which today allow to make things that, before, required JavaScript.

But I bet the evolutions of CSS coming soon will make SCSS obsolete, just like JavaScript new DOM selectors made a big part of jQuery useless.

I'm also very interested in PWA's, which I think will eventually replace native mobile applications (lightening the burden on developers) ; the Electron environment, which isn't perfect yes, seems very interesting too.

In my opinion, JavaScript is evolving so quickly, allowing it to reach, regularly, domains no one would have expected 15 years ago (native mobile applications, desktop softwares, and even game development), makes it a mandatory technology to learn today, at least for every web developer.

## üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on...

Any project I'll consider of public interest.

## üì´ How to reach me ...

Don't hesitate to send me a mail !
