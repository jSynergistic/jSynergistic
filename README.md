# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @jSynergistic !

I've been working in web development for about 15 years, at first in a small web agency as technical director, then in a more "classical " engineering company.

I worked for years mainly using PHP for the backend (which gave me the opportunity to create an MVC framework) and JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend. 

It makes me remember the Internet Explorer 5.5 / 6 versions, which didn't support the alpha channel of PNG images, as well as HTML tables based layouts (a real nightmare, believe me).

Layouts were so condensed, with sometimes font sizes of 10px, CSS was hardly beginning to be used, accessibility didn't seem to concern anyone, and JavaScript was mostly used for useless animations, when it dramatically replacing forms data validations. There were also stupid "Best viewed on ..." badges because each browser vendor had their own implementations.

There were no "hot refresh" neither, forcing us to refresh the page on each code modification, wich was so boring.

So today, with quality editors (eg. VS Code), awesome tools such as Webpack, NPM packages, JavaScript modules, Hot Modules Reloading, and many more, I really thing web development is 
most enjoyable today that ever, particularly with powerful libraries / frameworks such as React, Vue.js...

## üëÄ What am I interested in ?

I enjoy always watching innovations concerning the evolution of Internet, whether from a technological point of view, but also from the sociological impact of its uses.

## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning...

Mostly advanced uses of Javascript and CSS ; I decided a while ago to specialize on the "front" aspect, because the best application is just useless if the user experience is awful, as well as the biggest encyclopedia is empty if the information in it isn't accessible.

I mainly use React, with Typescript to build more robust web applications. I also enjoy using CSS (but also SCSS, CSS-in-JS, or Styled Components) wich today allow to make things that before required JavaScript.

I'm also interested in PWA's, which I think will eventually replace native mobile applications (lightening the developers' workload), and the Electron environment.

## üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on...
