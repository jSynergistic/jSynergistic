# 👋 Hi, I’m @jSynergistic !

I've been working in web development for about 15 years, at first in a small web agency as a web developer ; then I quickly became technical director of the agency, which gave me huge opportunities to learn fullstack web development, using PHP, CSS, HTML, and a bit of JavaScript (essentially using jQuery at this time where Internet Explorer 6 was condemning us to so many sacrifices 😆).

I worked for years mainly using PHP for the backend (during which I created an MVC framework whit an automatic CRUD) and JavaScript (ES4), HTML (v4), and CSS (v2.1) for the frontend. 

It makes me remember the Internet Explorer 5.5 / 6 versions, which didn't support the alpha channel of PNG images 😅. Also, when the designer was giving me Dreamweaver generated static pages based on deeply nested HTML tables layouts which I had to dynamize (a real nightmare, believe me ; the slightest mistake on a level made all the layout break down 🤯).

Layouts were so condensed, with sometimes font sizes of 10px, CSS was hardly beginning to be used, accessibility didn't ever seem to be considered by anyone, and JavaScript was mostly used for useless animations when they weren't just annoying ; some developers even believed they could replace server-side data validation with client-side validations (which could be user-friendly, but in no case constitute a replacement). There were also these so-annoying "Best viewed on ..." badges because each browser vendor had their own implementations.

On the development side... There were no "hot reload", no pre/post processors neithers, forcing us to refresh the page on each code modification, which was so tedious.

When I manage interns today, I can't tell them how lucky they are to be able to use such powerful tools as VS Code and its extensions, Webpack, NPM / Yarn / PNPM, and huge progress made with ES6. Also, to note, real progresses made by browsers vendors to support latest features. 

Clearly, I really think web development is most enjoyable today than ever, particularly with powerful frameworks or libraries such as React, VueJS, TailwindCSS... and sandbox participative platforms such as CodePen, CodeSandbox and many others.

## 👀 What am I interested in ?

I enjoy always watching innovations concerning the evolution of Internet, whether from a technological point of view, but also from the sociological impact of its usages.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning...

Mostly advanced uses of Javascript and CSS ; I decided a while ago to specialize on the "front" aspect, because the best application is just useless if the user experience is awful, as well as the biggest encyclopedia could as well be empty if the information it contains isn't accessible.

I mainly use React, with Typescript to build more robust web applications. I also enjoy using CSS (but also SCSS, CSS-in-JS, or Styled Components) wich today allow to make things that before required JavaScript.

I'm also interested in PWA's, which I think will eventually replace native mobile applications (lightening the developers' workload), and the Electron environment.

And, last but not least, I try to learn NodeJS to build backend side of web applications, and GraphQL APIs.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...

Any project I'll consider of public interest !
